The goal of `qexplore` is to streamline the process of exploring and
interrogating data. It allows users to quickly list rows of a data frame
that meet certain criteria or tabulate data based on specific
conditions.

## Installation

You can install `qexplore` from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("jarvisc1/qexplore")
```

`qexplore` is not currently available on
[CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/).

## Usage

Here are some examples of how to use `qexplore`. For more, refer to the
[documentation](https://github.com/jarvic1/qexplore).

### Listing Rows

Use `qlist` to filter and explore subsets of data:

``` r
library(qexplore)

# Example dataset
data <- data.frame(
  drink_type = c("Latte", "Espresso", "Cappuccino", "Americano"),
  size = c("Small", "Large", "Medium", "Large"),
  day_of_week = c("Mon", "Tue", "Wed", "Thu")
)

# List specific rows
data |>
  qlist(drink_type, size, day_of_week, in_ = 1:2)

# Filter and list
data |>
  qlist(drink_type, size, if_ = size == "Large")
```

### Tabulating Data

Use `qtab` to create summary tables:

``` r
# Tabulate a single variable
data |>
  qtab(drink_type)

# Tabulate two variables
data |>
  qtab(drink_type, size)

# Grouped tabulations
data |>
  qtab(drink_type, size, by_ = day_of_week)
```

### Advanced Tabulations

``` r
# Tabulate with a filter condition
data |>
  qtab(drink_type, size, if_ = size == "Large")

# Tabulate specific rows
data |>
  qtab(drink_type, size, in_ = 1:3)

# Group and filter tabulations
data |>
  qtab(drink_type, size, by_ = day_of_week, if_ = day_of_week %in% c("Mon", "Tue"))
```

## Acknowledgements

This package brings together if, in, and by arguments from Stata. It
replicates something similar that you can do in `data.table`. It also
fits a tidyverse framework and uses tidyverse especially `dplyr` and
`janitor`.

Iâ€™d like to thank everyone that was involved in all of the software
above. Especially `tidyplots` for the idea that you can take something
as well established as `ggplot2` and still make something possibly
quicker and maybe more accessible that might help enable more people to
use R.

`qexplore` leverages the following amazing packages to do the heavy
lifting: cli, dplyr, rlang, tidyselect, and tidyr.
